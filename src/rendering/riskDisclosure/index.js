                        <h2>1. High-Risk Investment Warning</h2>
                        <p>Trading in financial instruments, including foreign exchange (Forex), cryptocurrencies, commodities, indices, and derivatives, involves a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to trade or invest in financial markets, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, risk appetite, and financial situation.</p>
                        <p>There is a possibility that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with financial market trading and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts.</p>

                        <p>ChronosX employs machine learning models, statistical neural networks, and technical indicators to analyze market structures and detect chart patterns. While these algorithms are engineered for high precision, financial markets are influenced by unpredictable geopolitical events, market sentiment, macroeconomic shifts, and institutional order flows.</p>
                        <p>AI-generated analysis may contain delays, calculation variances, or false signals. ChronosX does not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, timeliness, or profitability of any signal, indicator, or automated insight generated on the platform.</p>

                        <p>Leveraged trading carries substantial risk. Minor price fluctuations in underlying currency pairs or digital assets can result in significant margin calls or total account liquidations. High volatility during macroeconomic announcements, central bank interest rate decisions, or unexpected global events can cause slippage, spread widening, and order execution delays outside the control of analytical software.</p>
